To encourage participation, make it easy for people to enter your running giveaway. Consider offering multiple ways to enter, such as following your social media accounts, visiting your website, or referring friends.

### 5. Use hashtags and tag relevant accounts
Hashtags and tagging relevant accounts can help your running giveaway reach a wider audience. Use relevant hashtags and tag other businesses or influencers in your posts to increase visibility.

To ensure the fairness and integrity of your running giveaway, it's important to select a winner in a transparent and unbiased manner. Consider using a random name generator or other objective method to choose the winner.
