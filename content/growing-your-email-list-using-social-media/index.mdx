## Introduction 
Social media contests are a great way to get more people to join your email list. They can help capture attention and drive growth in your email list by providing a value exchange which encourages members to leave their email address. Growing your email list using social media contests is a an effective approach that relies upon strategic execution of different techniques. With the right combination of creative tactics, you can build an impressive email list in little time.

### Step 1: Establish Your Goals 
Before you create your social media contest, you need to identify your objectives. Think about why you’re creating the contest and what outcome you’d like to see. Identifying your goals makes it easier to decide on a theme, the rules, and even the prizes. Some goals might include increasing email list subscribers, introducing new products or services, or promoting a sale.

### Step 2: Choose a Platform 
Before you dive into the specifics of how you’ll conduct the contest, you need to decide which platform you’ll use. Popular platforms for running contests include Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and Wufwuf. Keep in mind that the rules on each platform vary, so check the rules before you get started.

### Step 3: Pick a Prize 
Once you determine which platform you’ll use, it’s time to decide on the prize. This is an important decision, as the prize will ultimately make or break the success of your social media contest. The prize should be desirable, but it should also be something that aligns with your business.

### Step 4: Design the Contest 
Now it’s time to get creative. Once you establish the prize, you need to decide how people will enter the contest. If you’re using Twitter, you could ask people to tweet a photo using a specific hashtag. If you’re using Instagram, you could ask people to post a creative photo with a caption. Whatever platform you use and whatever rules you decide on, make sure they’re clear and concise.

### Step 5: Promote the Contest 
Once you’ve designed the contest, you need to promote it. A few days before the contest launches, post about it on your social media accounts and create a newsletter that goes out to your email list. You can also repost the content and post about it again on the day of the contest.

### Step 6: Track the Results 
Once the contest is over, it’s time to track the results. Measure the number of people who entered the contest, how many people subscribed to your email list, and how many people engaged with your content. Use this data to determine what worked and what didn’t.

## Summary 
Social media contests are an effective tool for growing your email list. Establish your goals and choose a platform, then pick a desirable prize and design the contest. Promote it on social media and track the results to see what worked and what didn’t. With the right combination of tactics and strategies, you can build an impressive email list in no time.
