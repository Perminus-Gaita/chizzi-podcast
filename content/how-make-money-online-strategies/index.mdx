## Overview of Online Business

An online business operates primarily via the internet, offering products/services through e-commerce platforms, digital tools, or content creation. Unlike traditional brick-and-mortar establishments, internet-based ventures offer unique advantages that make them particularly attractive for new entrepreneurs.

### Key Advantages of Online Businesses in Kenya

**Cost Efficiency:** No physical storefront needed; use dropshipping or digital products to minimize overhead. Platforms like Jumia and Copia allow sellers to reach customers without heavy initial investments, making internet-based ventures more affordable for Kenyan entrepreneurs.

**Global Reach:** Sell to customers worldwide using platforms like Shopify or Etsy. Your potential market isn't limited by geographic boundaries, allowing you to scale more rapidly than location-dependent businesses.

**Mobile Money Integration:** Services like M-Pesa simplify transactions, making it incredibly easy for businesses to collect payments from customers anywhere in the country. This digital payment ecosystem gives Kenya a significant advantage over many other markets.

### Traditional vs. Online Business Models

Traditional businesses in Kenya rely on physical locations and local foot traffic, limiting their reach to specific geographic areas. In contrast, online businesses can automate sales and marketing using platforms like WhatsApp Business and Facebook Marketplace, reaching customers across the country and even internationally.
