‚ö†Ô∏è **Remember!** Some cards can't start the game: 2s, 3s, Jacks, Queens, Kings, Aces, or Jokers. If you flip one, shuffle it back and try again!

## Playing Your First Turn
#### Basic Move: Match & Play
Match either the suit (‚ô†, ‚ô•, ‚ô¶, ‚ô£) or rank (4, 5, 6, etc.) of the top card. For example:

* If top card is 7‚ô•, you can play any ‚ô• or any 7

## Core Game Flow
Once you've mastered the basic move, here's how a typical turn flows:

1. Check the top card
2. Choose your action:

* Play a matching card
* Play a special card
* Draw if you can't play

4. Next player's turn

### Penalty Cards: Risks and Blocking Techniques
When someone plays a penalty card, the next player must either block it or draw cards:

#### Basic Penalties
- 2Ô∏è Two Card: Draw 2 cards
- 3Ô∏è Three Card: Draw 3 cards
- Joker: Draw 5 cards

#### Blocking Penalties
You can avoid drawing cards in three ways:
1. Play a matching penalty card (any 2 or 3)
2. Play any Joker
3. Play any Ace (without choosing a suit)

#### Example
If someone plays 2‚ô†:
1. You could play 2‚ô• (passes 2-card penalty to next player)
2. You could play a Joker (passes 5-card penalty to next player)
3. You could play any Ace (cancels the penalty)

<Alert type="variant">
### Stacking Variant
Some games allow penalties to accumulate until someone can't block:

Example with 4 players:
1. Player 1: 2‚ô£ (2 cards)
2. Player 2: Blocks with 2‚ô¶ (now 4 cards)
3. Player 3: Adds 3‚ô¶ (now 7 cards)
4. Player 4: Can't block ‚Üí Draws all 7 cards!

This creates exciting tension as the penalty grows!
