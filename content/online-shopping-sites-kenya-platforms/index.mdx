## Types of Platforms

### Online Shopping Sites

[Shopping websites in Kenya](https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/entertainment/news/article/2001353651/best-online-shops-in-kenya) focus primarily on the buyer experience, offering intuitive interfaces, product catalogs, and streamlined checkout processes. Platforms like Masoko and Sky Garden fall into this category, prioritizing features that enhance customer satisfaction and repeat business. Learn more in our [strategic guide on choosing the right selling platform](https://www.wufwuf.io/blog/choosing-right-selling-platform-guide).

### Selling Platforms

Selling platforms in Kenya provide [tools](https://www.shopify.com/blog/ecommerce-tools) specifically designed for merchants, including inventory management systems, analytics dashboards, and marketing integrations. Shopify and Jiji exemplify this category, offering features that help sellers optimize operations and boost sales.

### Hybrid Models

Some platforms successfully blend both approaches. Jumia, for example, serves both buyers and sellers with a comprehensive ecosystem that includes payment processing, logistics, and marketing tools. These hybrid models offer convenience but often come with higher fees.

## Key Features to Evaluate

### User-Friendliness

The interface design significantly impacts both seller and buyer experiences. Jumia offers an intuitive dashboard that simplifies product listings, while Shopify provides highly customizable interfaces that can be tailored to specific business needs. When selecting a platform, consider how much time you'll need to spend managing your store versus focusing on product development and marketing.

### Payment Integration

Kenyan consumers expect flexible payment options. Platforms like Kilimall and Sky Garden excel with their robust M-Pesa integration, making transactions seamless for the mobile-first Kenyan market. Evaluate each platform's payment ecosystem, particularly transaction fees and payout timelines.

### Scalability

As your online selling site in Kenya grows, your platform needs to accommodate increased traffic and inventory. Shopify stands out with tiered plans that evolve alongside your business, from basic storefronts to enterprise-level operations. Consider your long-term growth trajectory when selecting a platform—read more about scaling strategies in our [E-commerce Essentials guide](https://www.wufwuf.io/blog/build-optimize-scale-ecommerce-store).

### Customer Support

When technical issues arise, responsive support becomes invaluable. Jumia provides 24/7 helpline assistance for urgent matters, while Jiji offers community forums where sellers can exchange advice. Evaluate support options carefully, especially if you're new to e-commerce.
