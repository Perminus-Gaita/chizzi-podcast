## Understanding Puzzle Games

[Puzzle games](https://www.appier.com/en/blog/puzzle-game) are brain-teasing activities that require logic, pattern recognition, or strategic thinking to solve problems. They range from traditional formats like physical jigsaw puzzles to digital versions that you can play on your computer or mobile device.

What makes puzzle games so appealing is their dual role in providing entertainment while exercising your brain. By engaging different cognitive processes, they help improve problem-solving skills, boost memory, and enhance focus.

## Types of Puzzle Games

### Jigsaw Puzzles

The [jigsaw puzzle](https://www.britannica.com/topic/jigsaw-puzzle) has been a beloved pastime since its creation in 1760. Originally designed as educational tools for teaching geography, these puzzles consist of interlocking pieces that form a complete image when assembled correctly.
