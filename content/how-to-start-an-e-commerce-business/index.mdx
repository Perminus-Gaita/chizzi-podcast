## Introduction

Global e-commerce sales are projected to hit $6.09 trillion in 2024, growing by 8.4% and [expected to surpass $8 trillion by 2028](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/ecommerce-stats). The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this shift by up to five years, with mobile commerce alone projected to hit $2.07 trillion in 2024.
[E-commerce](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/e-commerce) (electronic commerce) refers to buying and selling goods or services online, including B2B, B2C, and C2C models. While "e-commerce" and "ecommerce" are interchangeable terms, "e-commerce" is typically used in more formal contexts.
This guide explains core concepts, business models, and actionable steps to [launch your ecommerce store](https://www.wufwuf.io/blog/how-to-start-an-e-commerce-business), helping you navigate this lucrative online business landscape.

## What is E-Commerce? (Definitions & Scope)
E-commerce involves online transactions via digital storefronts (websites or apps) and payment gateways like PayPal. These electronic transactions can involve physical products, digital goods, or services.

### Key Components:

* **[Digital storefronts](https://www.wufwuf.io/blog/build-optimize-scale-ecommerce-store):** These are websites or applications where products are displayed for customers, like Amazon's product pages.
* **Payment gateways:** Secure systems that process transactions, such as M-Pesa, Stripe or PayPal, ensuring safe transfer of funds.
* **Logistics and Fulfillment:** Efficient order processing and delivery are crucial for [customer satisfaction](https://riseuplabs.com/what-are-the-three-elements-of-e-commerce/).

### Types of E-Commerce:

* **B2B (Business-to-Business):** Businesses selling to other businesses, like Twiga Foods connecting manufacturers with retailers.
* **B2C (Business-to-Consumer):** Businesses selling directly to consumers, like Jumia selling products to shoppers.
* **C2C (Consumer-to-Consumer):** Individuals selling to each other, like Jiji's marketplace platform.
* **D2C (Direct-to-Consumer):** Brands bypassing middlemen to sell directly to customers, like Vivo Woman who sell to their customers directly via social media.

Understanding these distinctions helps identify [which ecommerce store model](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/types-of-ecommerce) best suits your business goals and target audience.

## E-Commerce Business Models
Choosing the right business model is crucial for your online business success. Each approach offers different advantages depending on your resources, expertise, and goals.
* **Dropshipping:**
This model allows selling products without inventory; suppliers ship directly to customers. For example, using [Shopify](https://www.wufwuf.io/blog/how-make-money-online-strategies) integrated with Doba or Oberlo lets you list products and fulfill orders without handling inventory.

* **Subscription Boxes:**
This model involves recurring curated product deliveries to customers on a regular schedule. For example, a subscription box service offering monthly deliveries of fresh produce sourced from local farmers could appeal to urban dwellers seeking convenience and quality.

* **Wholesaling:**
Selling products in bulk to retailers or businesses is the foundation of this model. Platforms like Twiga foods connect manufacturers with businesses looking to purchase in volume.

* **White-labeling:**
This involves rebranding generic products under your own label. Many private-label skincare brands purchase generic formulations and market them under their unique branding.

* **On-demand Services:**
These businesses create custom products after purchase. Glovo and Uber Eats exemplifies this model by connecting customers with restaurants for food prepared specifically after ordering.

Each selling platform aligns differently with these [business models](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/small-business/e-commerce-models). For instance, Shopify works exceptionally well for dropshipping while WooCommerce offers greater flexibility for custom white-label solutions.

## Frequently Asked Questions
### What's the cheapest way to start an e-commerce business?

### How much inventory should I start with?

This approach minimizes risk while allowing you to gauge customer interest before making larger inventory investments.

The sector is projected to grow significantly, with revenues expected to reach over [Ksh.450 billion by 2027](https://www.citizen.digital/business/kenya-targets-over-ksh450b-e-commerce-revenue-by-2027-boosting-job-creation-n353286), indicating substantial opportunities for entrepreneurs.
