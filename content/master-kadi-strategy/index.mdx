# Kadi Strategy Guide: From Basics to Tournament Play

Want to master Kadi? This guide covers everything from understanding your first hand to winning tournaments. Let's break down each aspect of the game.

## Core Strategic Principles

### Hand Evaluation
What makes a strong starting hand in Kadi? Look for these elements:

#### Strong Hand Components
* Penalty Cards (2, 3, Joker) - Force opponents to draw multiple cards
* Answer Cards (4-10) - Essential for winning
* Question Cards (Q, 8) with matching Answer Cards
* Counter Cards (J, K) for defense

ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip:** Having both Penalty Cards and Answer Cards gives you both offensive and defensive options.

### Resource Management

#### Managing Your Cards
* Save Penalty Cards to disrupt opponent's winning moves
* Keep Answer Cards that match your Question Cards
* Use Counter Cards (J, K) to protect your winning sequence

#### Draw Pile Strategy
* Track which Answer Cards have been played
* Count used Penalty Cards
* Watch for Question Card sequences

### Position Control

#### Using Counter Cards
* Jump Cards (J): Skip dangerous positions
* Kickback Cards (K): Change game direction
* Multiple Counter Cards: Create longer skips or direction changes

### Information Tracking
Track these key elements:
* Played Question Cards and their suits
* Used Answer Cards
* Deployed Counter Cards
* Announced "Niko Kadi" status

### Risk Assessment

Before making any move, evaluate:

* Card Count Risk
  * How many cards do opponents have?
  * Is anyone close to "Niko Kadi"?
  * What's left in the draw pile?

* Sequence Risk
  * Can opponents block your winning sequence?
  * Do they have Counter Cards left?
  * Are your Question-Answer pairs secure?

<Alert type="info">
ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip:** More cards in hand = higher risk of opponents having Counter Cards.

## Advanced Mechanics

* Eight â†’ Eight (any suit)
